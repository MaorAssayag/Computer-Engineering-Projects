# Digital Computer Structure for Computer Engineering

# Topics :
* Computer Structure: the digital computer and its main components, different bus configurations
and bus arbitration methods.
* Microprocessor Architecture: Von-Neuman, Harvard, programming model and CPU model, 3-bus architecture, pipeline architecture, 80x86 arcitecture, TI/ARM
microcontroller architecture.
* Memories: memory hierarchy and memory management, cache and interleaving memory, cache coherency, protection mode, virtual memory and protection in
multitasking system, segmentation and paging. 
* I/O Organization: connectivity of IO devices, IO processor, and host communication. Interrupts: interrupts techniques, event-driven real-time
systems, interrupt controller, cascade mode and dynamic programming.
* DMA: operation modes and techniques, DMA controller, and IO channel. Communication: introduction, serial synchronous and
asynchronous communication, protocols and introduction to LAN, modem interface, USART 8250
controller, RS232, RS485, I2C and SPI communication standards. 
* Projects: writing real time device drivers, and design of microcomputers system.
